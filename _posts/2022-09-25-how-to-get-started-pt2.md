## Welcome back to How to get started in IT! Part 2

Here we will pick up where we left off in part 1 on deciding to use a virtual machine. In part 3 I will talk about servers, mainly aiming at virtual private servers.

### So, what is a virtual machine (commonly known as VM)?

A computer, like a laptop or a workstation, uses software instead of a physical computer to run operating systems (OS). Basically, VMs gives you the ability to run a whole new computer inside a contained environment that is separate from your computer. You might be wondering why they are separated, that is because they are considered to be their own computer and that makes it easy to test an app for bugs on different types of platforms before handing it out to the public.

### How do virtual machines work?
The virtual machine runs as a process in an application window, similar to any other application, on the operating system of the physical machine. Key files that make up a virtual machine include a log file, NVRAM setting file, virtual disk file, and configuration file. 

### So what are the advantages of using a virtual machine?
There are several advantages, including saving physical space, time and management costs, and can also provide integrated disaster recovery and application provisioning options.

### The disadvantage of using virtual machines.
Virtual Machines tend to be less efficient and run slower than a full physical computer. Businesses tend to use both physical and VMs to help balance the performance depending on their needs.

So overall VMs can be quite handy for testing beta versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux-based operating systems. If you want to run a Virtual Machine, be sure to know the minimum requirements that the operating system needs. Generally, I recommend doubling for what's needed if you want to have a good experience. I recommend using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) if you plan to run a VM on a desktop. On a side note, you should watch some youtube videos on setting up a Virtual Machine.
