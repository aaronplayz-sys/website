## Why was AquaNovaNetwork removed?

That my dear reader is because the "team" never pitched in to help me with the development, leaving me to do everything.

## Got bored & moved on to other things

Not only that doing this had me bored out of my mind. I had an "itch" to do something more valuable with my free time. And that was repurposing my VPS to run DNS (Domain Name Server) and configure it to block ads, trackers, malware, etc... **NO** you can **not use it**.

### Why not?

Because this has been setup in away that it works for me, making it usable to everyone will make maintaining hard.

However will give you the github link to the software that I am using. Feel free to deploy your instance if it fits your needs.
