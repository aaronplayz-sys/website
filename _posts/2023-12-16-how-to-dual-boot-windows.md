## Assumptions

Before we get started, there are a few things that I assume you have on hand, have the knowledge of and are comfortable doing.

- Know the layout of your UEFI/BIOS menu
- Boot override
- A dedicated drive to install your choice of Linux distribution

## Downloading the ISO

First, you want to navigate to your choice of Linux distribution website and save the `ISO file` somewhere you can `easily find` it. For this guide, I am going to use Nobara Linux as an example.
