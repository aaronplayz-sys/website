## What dose "IT" even mean?
Simple enough it mean **I**nformation **T**echnology. Which are servers, computers, phones, cameras.... I think you get the point here.

## How to get started
Believe it or not it's quite easy, it's the matter of knowing how to do it. Don't I'll try my best to make everything clear to those who are new to this approach.

### Virtual Machine or a server
Now there's a difference between the two. One fact of course you are going to have to pay a monthly price to have a linux server. Running a virtual machine pretty much depends on the hardware resources you have & willing to allocate them. Both have their pros & cons, so ultimately boils down to where if you want to have a hands on experience with a linux desktop or getting a server from linode, vultr, etc. But in this post I'm focusing on the raspberry pi, I will follow up on these two in future posts.
#### Or if you are willing, buy a raspberrypi 4
If you don't have the resources or don't want to have to pay a monthly fee a raspberrypi 4 is an excellent choice! Please keep in mind that the price tends to be around $100 or more as of all the crisis that has happened this year (2022). For the newbies(I mean to be disrespectful) I recommend this starter kit [raspberry pi 4 starter max kit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-max-kit.html) from canakit. Or you can freely choose any kit from here: [https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-4-kits](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-4-kits)  

After you got your raspberrypi 4, you can tinker around with it and do stuff like running your own wordpress website off of it. There's alot of opportunity with this credit card sized board. If you want inspiration or some guides go ahead and check out Pi [My Life Up](https://pimylifeup.com/), they have DIY projects, tutorials, and guides articles. I used that site myself!
