Ranger is my intention to have it as open source where anyone can see, take and even modify the code to their own liking. There are many projects out there, as I searched the web I couldn't find such a bot written in Node.js and is freely accessible to the public with up-to-date discord code (if that makes any sense). As of the year 2022 Discord made prefix commands legacy and prone to be obsolete. So I took it upon myself to make a bot that only has slash commands and make it available to the public without expecting anything in return.

Feel free to check out the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/aaronplayz-sys/ranger)

Or go ahead and clone my repo and start tinkering! Be sure to know Node.js, TypeScript, and Discord JS.

> It should be noted that I have archived this GitHub repository and is no longer maintained by me due to putting more time to making cogs for Red Discord bot as this is much simpler option for me and supports slash commands! Anyone is still free to fork and use Ranger.
