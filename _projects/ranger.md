Ranger is my intesion to have it as opens source where anyone can see, take and even modify the code to their ownliking. There are many projects out there, as I searched the web I couldn't find such a bot written in NodeJS and is freely accessible to the public with up to date discord code (if that makes any sense). As of the year 2022 Discord made prefix commands legacy and prone to be obsolete. So I took it upon myself to make a bot that only has slash commands and  make it avaliable to the public without expecting anything in return.

Feel free to check out the  guthub repo [here](https://github.com/aaronplayz-sys/ranger)

Or go ahead and clone my repo and start tinkering! Be sure to know NodeJS, TypeScript, and DiscordJS.
