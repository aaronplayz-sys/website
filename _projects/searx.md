![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/searxng/searxng/master/src/brand/searxng.svg)       Privacy-respecting, hackable [metasearch engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine)

So why host my own search engine when it's already made? Well the thing is that there is no actual home server! Anyone who is running an instance is helping making a stand for a pro private internet search engine. Sure there are others like [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/) that is  100% committed into respecting your online privacy. Most people would use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), but they did lose their trust in a lot of people in 2022 by allowing Microsoft trackers to track their users because of their "search agreement" and tried to rub it off like it was nothing. People who take their privacy seriously (like me) looked elsewhere to use another search engine.

Of course I did indeed no longer use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)- but I stopped using that search engine about a year before the whitelist tracker. I was using [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/) for quite some time, like when it first hit beta. A awesome replacement and in my opinion is better than [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) completely.

## If Brave Search is so much better than DuckDuckG0, why host a search engine node?
That my friend was from a fellow college classmate. Both him and I did many projects when we took the same class, eventually he said "why don't we run our own?". To be honest, at the school we were limited to what we can do, so I decided to spin up a VPS (Virtual Private Server) run a node.

## Cool! Can I use it?
Be my guest! although I highly recommend that you host your own instance/node instead or choose a publicly listed one from [searx.space](https://searx.space/).
Here's my instance: https://search.aaronplayzgaming.com/

## Want to run your own instance/node?
Check out their documentation & github repo:

 - https://docs.searxng.org/
 - https://github.com/searxng/searxng

## Update 8/16/2022
I have taken down my searxng instance due to unkown reasons as the site constantly returns too many requests errors, I do plan on making the website usable again!
