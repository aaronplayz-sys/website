## What's a Mesmer Yearbook??

Mesmer yearbook is a website that contains photos & videos for different years.

## What's my involvement has to do with this website?

I am (at the time of writing) a high ranking member in the roblox group called "Mesmer". Mesmer is a hybrid war clan. A hybrid war clan means that the group engages in guns and swords defenses and raids.

The leader of the group asked me if I knew how to build a website. I said "I do." I wasn't the first person that was asked. The high ranks only has three people. Me, Ohriginal(Leader), and K_oyori. I believe K_oyori had no knowledge on building websites and that's probably the same case with Ohriginal. Although I wished I had more control over how the site is hosted. See, Ohriginal wanted me to use [google sites](https://sites.google.com) since it was least likely for the host to just randomly disappear. Which made sense. What I wanted to do was build a wordpress website that I can spin off from one of my servers, that way we do not have to worry about where the actual hell the data is being stored. I did in fact made a website using google sites, and also in my free time to make a wordpress clone. Mainly to satisfy my urges to make a wordpress site and have more control over the data.
