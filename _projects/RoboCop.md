## RoboCop - My multipurpose discord bot

My bot was originally just a set of commands in just one big file. That is until I found Red Discord Bot that helps with the ground layer. From there, I customized it to my liking. Yes, I am using work that others have done and using it. Still, I also wrote my commands for the bot and also maintained code that others made but never updated them. Plus, some command creators are using other platforms that I do not have an account. I do not claim 100% credit for those, I maintain them only for the use case for the features I want in a bot without paying a dime.

## Notable features with my bot
- YouTube channel notifications
- Twitch livestream notifications (1-minute delay after channel goes live, API restrictions)
- Most commands are hybrid (supports the traditional prefix command and slash commands)
- Renaming voice channels without having to go to the settings
- Moderation system that can do automated actions (if setup, optional)
- Auto role new members when they join your server
- Let users assign roles to themselves
- Set requirements to get role(s)

## Cogs Repository

As mentioned before, I wrote some of these commands and maintain code that is not mine. Anyone is free to use these cogs. So feel free to go to my bots repository and use them with your Red Discord Bot.
