<p>That my dear reader is because the “team” never pitched in to help me with the development, leaving me to do everything.</p>

<h2 id="got-bored--moved-on-to-other-things">Got bored &amp; moved on to other things</h2>

<p>Not only that doing this had me bored out of my mind. I had an “itch” to do something more valuable with my free time. And that was repurposing my VPS to run DNS (Domain Name Server) and configure it to block ads, trackers, malware, etc… <strong>NO</strong> you can <strong>not use it</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="why-not">Why not?</h3>

<p>Because this has been setup in away that it works for me, making it usable to everyone will make maintaining hard.</p>

<p>However will give you the github link to the software that I am using. Feel free to deploy your instance if it fits your needs.</p>

<p>Here we will pick up where we left off in part 1 on deciding to use a virtual machine. In part 3 I will talk about servers, mainly aiming at virtual private servers.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-is-a-virtual-machine-commonly-known-as-vm">So, what is a virtual machine (commonly known as VM)?</h3>

<p>A computer, like a laptop or a workstation, uses software instead of a physical computer to run operating systems (OS). Basically, VMs gives you the ability to run a whole new computer inside a contained environment that is separate from your computer. You might be wondering why they are separated, that is because they are considered to be their own computer and that makes it easy to test an app for bugs on different types of platforms before handing it out to the public.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-virtual-machines-work">How do virtual machines work?</h3>

<p>The virtual machine runs as a process in an application window, similar to any other application, on the operating system of the physical machine. Key files that make up a virtual machine include a log file, NVRAM setting file, virtual disk file, and configuration file.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-are-the-advantages-of-using-a-virtual-machine">So what are the advantages of using a virtual machine?</h3>

<p>There are several advantages, including saving physical space, time and management costs, and can also provide integrated disaster recovery and application provisioning options.</p>

<h3 id="the-disadvantage-of-using-virtual-machines">The disadvantage of using virtual machines</h3>

<p>Virtual Machines tend to be less efficient and run slower than a full physical computer. Businesses tend to use both physical and VMs to help balance the performance depending on their needs.</p>

<p>So overall VMs can be quite handy for testing beta versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux-based operating systems. If you want to run a Virtual Machine, be sure to know the minimum requirements that the operating system needs. Generally, I recommend doubling for what’s needed if you want to have a good experience. I recommend using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> if you plan to run a VM on a desktop. On a side note, you should watch some youtube videos on setting up a Virtual Machine.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="IT," /><category term="Virtual-Machine," /><category term="VM," /><category term="how-to" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here I'll explain how you or anyone can easily get started in exploring IT, to make it easy I broke this into parts]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to get started in IT!

<p>Simple enough it mean <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>T</strong>echnology. Which are servers, computers, phones, cameras…. I think you get the point here.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2>

<p>Believe it or not it’s quite easy, it’s the matter of knowing how to do it. Don’t I’ll try my best to make everything clear to those who are new to this approach.</p>

<h3 id="virtual-machine-or-a-server">Virtual Machine or a server</h3>

<p>Now there’s a difference between the two. One fact of course you are going to have to pay a monthly price to have a linux server. Running a virtual machine pretty much depends on the hardware resources you have &amp; willing to allocate them. Both have their pros &amp; cons, so ultimately boils down to where if you want to have a hands on experience with a linux desktop or getting a server from linode, vultr, etc. But in this post I’m focusing on the raspberry pi, I will follow up on these two in future posts.</p>

<h4 id="or-if-you-are-willing-buy-a-raspberrypi-4">Or if you are willing, buy a raspberrypi 4</h4>

<p>If you don’t have the resources or don’t want to have to pay a monthly fee a raspberrypi 4 is an excellent choice! Please keep in mind that the price tends to be around $100 or more as of all the crisis that has happened this year (2022). For the newbies(I mean to be disrespectful) I recommend this starter kit <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-max-kit.html">raspberry pi 4 starter max kit</a> from canakit. Or you can freely choose any kit from here: <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-4-kits">https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-4-kits</a></p>

<p>After you got your raspberrypi 4, you can tinker around with it and do stuff like running your own wordpress website off of it. There’s alot of opportunity with this credit card sized board. If you want inspiration or some guides go ahead and check out Pi <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/">My Life Up</a>, they have DIY projects, tutorials, and guides articles. I used that site myself!</p>

<p>If your familiar with ad blockers then this is what it is essentially. A list (similar blocklist) listing domains that tells your ad blocker and/or your pi hole or AdGuard Home server to allow requests from the domains in that list to be processed.</p>

<p>The reason why I recommend that you make your own whitelist is because certain websites that you visit or your app that connects to the internet may be blocked by whatever extension or adblocking server. I had my fair share of this. My bank, yes seriously my bank! My bank has their domain CNAME to another server that my AdGuard Home instance blocks, of course there is a built in whitelist function but blacklists have a priority over the built in whitelist. Same thing happened to a game. So I decided to make my own whitelist that is dedicated to my needs since only my devices are configured to use the dns server in my household. Making the whitelist pretty much tells the adblocker or in my case my AdGuard Home server to allow the domains I specify to be processed.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-can-i-make-my-own-whitelist">So how can I make my own whitelist?</h2>

<p>It’s quite easy if I’m being honest, once you know the rules for adblocking. Don’t know? It’s OK. Here’s the documentation that should work for most adblock extensions &amp; servers like AdGuard home: <a href="https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters#introduction">https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters#introduction</a></p>

<p>If that article didn’t help then try reading this one: <a href="https://help.eyeo.com/en/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters">https://help.eyeo.com/en/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters</a></p>

<p>So after reading up on those, you should now have a pretty good understanding how to mack filter lists. I’ll give an example of a domain to whitelist:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@@||tinyurl.com^*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code whitelists <a href="tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a>, a well known link shortener service. In certain block list this domain could be blocked. You may be wondering (if you read the articles I had linked) that I added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^*</code> to the end of the domain. This ensures that the domain &amp; all it’s pages can load without being blocked. This is from personal experience but most cases <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@@||(domain here)</code> should do the trick.</p>

<p>You can checkout my whitelist &amp; use it as a reference. Or you can use it, all up to you! <a href="https://aaronplayzgaming.com/recommended-whitelist.txt">https://aaronplayzgaming.com/recommended-whitelist.txt</a></p>
