After reading articles and watching videos online. Using a different DNS server can sometimes be a small improvement to your online experience. For this reason I had always pointed my devices to quad9 or Cloudflare servers because of were they are based and their logging policies.</p> <h2 id="using-pihole">Using Pihole</h2> <p>Now, I do not have any hate for pihole, I could never seem to find my way around the menu. To many this software does wonders. For me, it felt too technical to use and stuck with DNS servers that filter ads and more with providers like AdGuard DNS. For a while this suited my needs, then I wanted to include more extensive lists to expand the coverage.</p> <p>Sure using providers like AdGuard DNS or NextDNS are awesome. The only factor that keeps me from using them are having to pay monthly to keep the filtering service active as most limit the free tier to around 300k requests a month. I did use NextDNS on my phone exclusively for a while to see if I could hit that monthly limit. I have to say, it’s not, so bad live off on the free tier if only one device is pointed to the server with your identifier.</p> <h2 id="the-release-of-adguard-home">The release of AdGuard Home</h2> <p>When this software came out, I decided to try it out and deployed it on my network. To me this software has a more modern take on handling DNS request and the ability to use DNS-Over-HTTPS and DNS-Over-TLS protocol. Something that pihole can not do out of the box without you having to set up additional software to use DNS-Over-HTTPS.</p> <p>AdGuard Home can handle different types rules when it comes to blocking IP’s and domains. It understands traditional rules used in ad blocking extensions, host-style (IP addresses), or just a list of domain names.</p> <p>Since AdGuard Home is a self-host solution, you have more control over what it can do compared to a cloud solution like AdGuard DNS in terms of fine-tuning to your liking.</p> <h2 id="my-configuration">My configuration</h2> <p>There are many ways to set up AdGuard Home as there a few ways to block and whitelist domains. I have closely followed yokoffing’s guide on <a href="https://github.com/yokoffing/NextDNS-Config">NextDNS-Config</a> as a based for filters. The rest of my config was inspired from Reddit posts I saw and experimenting with settings.</p> <h3 id="general-settings">General settings</h3> <p>Filter update interval: 24 hours</p> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <h5 id="tip">TIP</h5> <p>Most lists, including the ones I’m using update once a day.</p> </blockquote> <p>Optional: Enable AdGuard browsing security web service</p> <p>Optional: Enable AdGuard parental control web service</p> <blockquote class="block-warning"> <h5 id="warning">WARNING</h5> <p>These web services preforms API lookups on the domains you browse.

Unlike the blocklists page, there isn’t any built-in lists to choose from. The easy way to whitelist domain is to click unblock on the request that was blocked in the query log page.</p> <p>Alternatively you can host your list on GitHub or anywhere the .txt file is accessible.

Useful if you are running a home lab. For example, you can use .local as this will only resolve within your local network. It can also stop domains like .zip that either redirects to a scam site or execute malware on your computer.</p> <p>Add the following domains to the page exactly as you see it in the table below.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Domain</th> <th>Answer</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.zip</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.cfd</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.discount</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.gdn</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.loan</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.loans</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.ooo</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.sbs</code></td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> is used as a wildcard, targeting every domain regardless if the domain has a subdomain.

Part 2</h2> <blockquote> <p>If you didn’t read part 1, then stop and read part 1 <a href="https://aaronplayzgaming.com/blog/2022/how-to-get-started/">here.</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Here we will pick up where we left off in part 1 on deciding to use a virtual machine. In part 3 I will talk about servers, mainly aiming at virtual private servers.</p> <h3 id="so-what-is-a-virtual-machine-commonly-known-as-vm">So, what is a virtual machine (commonly known as VM)?</h3> <p>A computer, like a laptop or a workstation, uses software instead of a physical computer to run operating systems (OS). Basically, VMs gives you the ability to run a whole new computer inside a contained environment that is separate from your computer. You might be wondering why they are separated, that is because they are considered to be their own computer and that makes it easy to test an app for bugs on different types of platforms before handing it out to the public.</p> <h3 id="how-do-virtual-machines-work">How do virtual machines work?</h3> <p>The virtual machine runs as a process in an application window, similar to any other application, on the operating system of the physical machine. Key files that make up a virtual machine include a log file, NVRAM setting file, virtual disk file, and configuration file.</p> <h3 id="so-what-are-the-advantages-of-using-a-virtual-machine">So what are the advantages of using a virtual machine?</h3> <p>There are several advantages, including saving physical space, time and management costs, and can also provide integrated disaster recovery and application provisioning options.</p> <h3 id="the-disadvantage-of-using-virtual-machines">The disadvantage of using virtual machines</h3> <p>Virtual Machines tend to be less efficient and run slower than a full physical computer. Businesses tend to use both physical and VMs to help balance the performance depending on their needs.</p> <p>So overall VMs can be quite handy for testing beta versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux-based operating systems. If you want to run a Virtual Machine, be sure to know the minimum requirements that the operating system needs. Generally, I recommend doubling for what’s needed if you want to have a good experience. I recommend using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> if you plan to run a VM on a desktop. On a side note, you should watch some youtube videos on setting up a Virtual Machine.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="IT,"/><category term="Virtual-Machine,"/><category term="VM,"/><category term="how-to"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here I'll explain how you or anyone can easily get started in exploring IT, to make it easy I broke this into parts]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to get started in IT!

Which are servers, computers, phones, cameras…. I think you get the point here.</p> <h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2> <p>Believe it or not it’s quite easy, it’s the matter of knowing how to do it. Don’t I’ll try my best to make everything clear to those who are new to this approach.</p> <h3 id="virtual-machine-or-a-server">Virtual Machine or a server</h3> <p>Now there’s a difference between the two. One fact of course you are going to have to pay a monthly price to have a linux server. Running a virtual machine pretty much depends on the hardware resources you have &amp; willing to allocate them. Both have their pros &amp; cons, so ultimately boils down to where if you want to have a hands on experience with a linux desktop or getting a server from linode, vultr, etc. But in this post I’m focusing on the raspberry pi, I will follow up on these two in future posts.</p> <h4 id="or-if-you-are-willing-buy-a-raspberrypi-4">Or if you are willing, buy a raspberrypi 4</h4> <p>If you don’t have the resources or don’t want to have to pay a monthly fee a raspberrypi 4 is an excellent choice! Please keep in mind that the price tends to be around $100 or more as of all the crisis that has happened this year (2022). For the newbies(I mean to be disrespectful) I recommend this starter kit <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-max-kit.html">raspberry pi 4 starter max kit</a> from canakit. Or you can freely choose any kit from here: <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-4-kits">https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-4-kits</a></p> <p>After you got your raspberrypi 4, you can tinker around with it and do stuff like running your own wordpress website off of it. There’s alot of opportunity with this credit card sized board. If you want inspiration or some guides go ahead and check out Pi <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/">My Life Up</a>, they have DIY projects, tutorials, and guides articles.

A list (similar blocklist) listing domains that tells your ad blocker and/or your pi hole or AdGuard Home server to allow requests from the domains in that list to be processed.</p> <p>The reason why I recommend that you make your own whitelist is because certain websites that you visit or your app that connects to the internet may be blocked by whatever extension or adblocking server. I had my fair share of this. My bank, yes seriously my bank! My bank has their domain CNAME to another server that my AdGuard Home instance blocks, of course there is a built in whitelist function but blacklists have a priority over the built in whitelist. Same thing happened to a game. So I decided to make my own whitelist that is dedicated to my needs since only my devices are configured to use the dns server in my household. Making the whitelist pretty much tells the adblocker or in my case my AdGuard Home server to allow the domains I specify to be processed.</p> <h2 id="so-how-can-i-make-my-own-whitelist">So how can I make my own whitelist?</h2> <p>It’s quite easy if I’m being honest, once you know the rules for adblocking. Don’t know? It’s OK. Here’s the documentation that should work for most adblock extensions &amp; servers like AdGuard home: <a href="https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters#introduction">https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters#introduction</a></p> <p>If that article didn’t help then try reading this one: <a href="https://help.eyeo.com/en/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters">https://help.eyeo.com/en/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters</a></p> <p>So after reading up on those, you should now have a pretty good understanding how to mack filter lists. I’ll give an example of a domain to whitelist:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@@||tinyurl.com^*
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This code whitelists <a href="tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a>, a well known link shortener service. In certain block list this domain could be blocked. You may be wondering (if you read the articles I had linked) that I added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^*</code> to the end of the domain. This ensures that the domain &amp; all it’s pages can load without being blocked. This is from personal experience but most cases <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@@||(domain here)</code> should do the trick.</p> <p>You can checkout my whitelist &amp; use it as a reference. Or you can use it, all up to you! <a href="https://aaronplayzgaming.com/recommended-whitelist.txt">https://aaronplayzgaming.com/recommended-whitelist.txt</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Written with <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>.</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here I go into why I made my own list and why you may need to aswell.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Test post</title><link href="https://aaronplayzgaming.com/blog/2022/update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Test post"/><published>2022-06-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-06-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://aaronplayzgaming.com/blog/2022/update</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aaronplayzgaming.com/blog/2022/update/"><![CDATA[<p>Was just clearing out some template stuff :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="Test"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a test post]]></summary></entry></feed>
