I am always looking for new topics of interest, projects, etc... This ranges from computer hardware to IOT (Internet Of Things) devices, and programming. For example, this website is a static website! I used to use a CMS like WordPress. What happened to it? Well, let's just say over time it became a burden to maintain the system WordPress was running on & having to constantly ensure the data in the database was secure didnâ€™t make a lot of sense to me. So I tried different solutions and eventually settled with a static website as I don't need to do so much maintenance.
