I am always looking interesting topic, projects, etc...

This ranges from computer hardware to IOT (Internet Of Things) devices. For example this static website! And yes this is a static website! I used to use a CMS to have website. What happend to it?

So I tried GitHub Pages with a jekelly theme that peaked my intrest! Amazing right!
