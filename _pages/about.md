I am Aaron Khan, currently a student at Valencia College pursuing a degree in AS Computer Information Technology. I also maintain a website where I write articles and guides about IT and personal interests. Furthermore, I enjoy building computer systems and configuring operating systems, whether it's for gaming or experimenting with different Linux distributions. Also, I have experience with cloud computing and particularly interested in virtual servers. In high school, I took college-level classes and became certified in CompTIA IT Fundamentals and Entrepreneurship and Small Business. I am known as the "tech guy" in the family and enjoys teaching them about technology. I joined the Phi Theta Kappa honor society, which offers benefits like hotel discounts.
